# What is ApolReady?

In my first year of Speech and Debate, I was constantly struggling to write good Apologetics speeches that could be easily edited even more easily shared with others. Using Microsoft Word suffices at times, but formatting the cards to be of proper proportions was beginning to be a great burden upon my time frame! Overall, I wanted a solution that helped format Apologetics cards, so that I could focus on the rhetoric rather than the physical appearance of the notecard.

This is why I created ApolReady. Using web technology, one can access ApolReady from anywhere, and write their answer card with less worrying about physical properties and more about the card that they are creating.

# Desktop Client:

We are hard at work creating a desktop app for ApolReady so that it can be installed on computers and accessed without an internet connection. Check back later, or help us out now!
