In my first year of Speech and Debate, I was constantly struggling to write good Apologetics speeches that could be easily edited and even more easily shared with others. Using Microsoft Word suffices at times, but formatting the cards to be of proper proportions was beginning to be a great burden upon my time frame! Overall, I wanted a solution that helped format Apologetics cards, so that I could focus on the rhetoric rather than the physical appearance of the notecard.

This is why I created ApolReady. Using web technology, one can access ApolReady from anywhere, and write their answer card with less worrying about physical properties and more about the card that they are creating.

# How to use:

We are hard at work creating a Alpha testing version of this application for Windows. Check back at [our website](https://Aaron-Mann.github.io/ApolReady) to download a full copy of ApolReady. After Alpha testing, complete versions will be released for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Currently, testing is done through [NPM (Node Package Manager)](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) commands in terminal.

However, recent developments have proven package testing successful, and have created a zip file for Windows installation only. [please visit our website](https://Aaron-Mann.github.io/ApolReady) for downloads and instructions. Thats it! This zip is the latest stable version packaged, however, stable versions are being added daily if you are savy enough to use terminal commands to install.
