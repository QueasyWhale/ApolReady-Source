            <h2>What is ApolReady?</h2>
            <p>In my first year of Speech and Debate, I was constantly struggling to type Apologetics speeches that are formated into the proper dimensions. Using Microsoft Word sufficed at times, but formatting the cards to be of proper proportions was beginning to be a great burden. Overall, I wanted a solution that helped format Apologetics cards, so that I could focus on the rhetoric rather than the physical appearance of the notecard.</p>
            <p>This is why I created ApolReady. ApolReady helps Speech and Debate students write their answer card with less worrying about physical properties and more about the speech that they are creating.</p>
